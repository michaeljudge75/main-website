# Resume Website Built with React :page_with_curl:

# Description
This is a website built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I forked this project from another github and made the appropriate changes so that the information is relevant to me. I am using this website as a way to expand on my resume and allow for potential employeers get more information about my experiences and qualifications in addition to allowing them to contact me more easily
